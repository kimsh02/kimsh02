    &ldquo;The most inquisitive and curious-minded of that family was called Sméagol. He was interested in roots and beginnings; he dived into deep pools; he burrowed under trees and growing plants; he tunnelled into green mounds; and he ceased to look up at the hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the flowers opening in the air: his head and his eyes were downward.
    <br>[&hellip;]
    <br>All the &lsquo;great secrets&rsquo; under the mountains had turned out to be just empty night.&rdquo;
